# dev-random: exploring one idea per day with code

The rules are:

- each experiment must take no more than a day, and ideally no more
  than 4 hours;
- there must be some text that explains the idea;
- there must be some code that illustrates the idea.

Why?

A day is the natural unit for focusing on one thing without
interruption given that we must sleep at night.

What to expect:

- a vague starting point;
- a vague conclusion, if any at all;
- incomplete explanations;
- inconsistent terminology;
- many mistakes;
- no finished software that you could use as is.
